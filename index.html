<p>We are still a very verbal society.  Even though the keyboard and mouse has been the default input for the online world, with the mobile evolution, every person now has a connected device in their pocket--the opportunity for voice search and other audio based online interaction is exploding.</p>
<p>While voice is nothing new as a computer interface, it doesn't seem like all the pieces were in place for success--until we saw Siri from Apple.</p>
<p>Siri has ushered in a new approach to using voice as a tool for not just searching, but actually interactig in real-time with your onlie world.</p>
<p>APIs will be the channel in which voice finds the data and information it needs to fulfill requests made by mobile and web users worldwide.</p>
<p>There are several platforms focusing on the world of API and voice. In this section I will be tracking on news and companies that are doing interesting things around API to Voice, while also sharing blog analysis as well.</p>
