<p>Twilio short codes are a powerful tool for reaching your users faster, enabling your app to send messages at a rate of 1,800 per minute.This high-throughput is perfect for apps that need to send time-sensitive or bulk messages.But with great power comes great responsibility.Wireless carriers, together with organizations like the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) and the Wireless Association (CTIA), have developed a rigorous set of requirements that all short code programs must meet.While these requirements are documented in detail in Twilioâ€™s Help Center, we know that not everyone enjoys reading up on messaging compliance standards as much as we do.</p>
