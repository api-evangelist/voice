<p>Datalot’s focus is to help you execute the best customer acquisition strategy possible on both web and mobile platforms.And now you can easily set up a Twilio-powered call center or voicecamp with DialDrive, an end-to-end phone platform.From lead generation to deploying an entire cloud-based call center, DialDrive has you covered – and might have some of the sexiest dashboards we’ve seen yet.DialDrive has an insane amount of features, but here’s a few cool examples of things you can do within this platform:
  Buy targeted live call transfers on-demand 
  Manage complex inbound call campaigns 
  Build your own pay-per-call network 
  Deploy a complete cloud-based call center infrastructure 
 Analyze detailed metrics of phone agent performance
 
DialDrive is built with Twilio Client and incorporates WebRTC, a set of open-source communications protocols for using a browser to exchange audio, video and data streams.In a call center environment, WebRTC leads to improved voice quality and a better user experience than Flash.</p>
