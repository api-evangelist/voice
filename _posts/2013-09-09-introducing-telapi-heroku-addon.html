<p>One of TelAPI’s foremost goals is making the lives of developers easier when building Telephony applications.Heroku is a platform developers can use to make their lives easier when building ANY type of application.Thats why we’re super excited to announce the public beta of our Heroku Addon.Starting today, developers on the Heroku platform can integrate with TelAPI in minutes.With the the TelAPI Heroku Addon, your app can now send outbound SMS messages, place outbound calls, and even purchase dedicated phone numbers for receiving inbound SMS and calls.</p>
