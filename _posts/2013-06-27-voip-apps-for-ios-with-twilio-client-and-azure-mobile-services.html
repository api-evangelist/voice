<p>W indows Azure Mobile Services makes it easy for developers to quickly set up a scalable backend for their mobile applications.  You could, of course, take advantage of this in your Windows 8 or Windows Phone applications, but Microsoft has made client SDKs available for native iOS and Android apps as well.  Now with a few clicks in the Windows Azure admin console, you can store data in the cloud without any server-side code.In this tutorial, we will focus on how to integrate with these services on iOS as we customize a simple todo list application.  We will also be integrating Twilio Client, which will enable us to dial phone number links directly from our iOS app.</p>
