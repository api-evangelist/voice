<p>Who knew that donations could be so expensive?Pittsburgh NPR affiliate radio stations WESA and WYEP, wanted to launch a call-based membership drive but quickly hit a roadblock.Their old analog phones were outdated and too expensive to use for a large scale membership drive.WESA and WYEP used Twilio to power the campaign, and quickly built a new way to reach out to listeners via SMS.We talked to Russ Loyd (pictured above),  the Director of Technology for WYEP, WESA about their successful membership drive, bringing music and news to Pittsburgh and what’s next for the station.</p>
