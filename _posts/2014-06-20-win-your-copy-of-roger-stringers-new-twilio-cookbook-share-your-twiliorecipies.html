<p>Roger Stringer is back with a second edition of his Twilio Cookbook and we want to give you a copy.The cookbook is a one-stop shop for all the recipes and code samples you to build your own Twilio projects.In this new edition, Roger shows you how to use Twilio Picture Messaging, Call <Queue>ing, Twilio Client and more to create anything from own Picture Messaging Gallery to a browser-based phone support system.We have copies of the new Cookbook with your name on it, all you have to do to get one is share your favorite Twilio recipes, a gist, and tweet it to us with the hashtag #TwilioRecipes.Pick or write your favorite snippet of code that helped you build that Donna Summers themed conference line, or Game of Thrones SMS quiz (okay, those might be my own personal ideas).</p>
