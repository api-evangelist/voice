<p>Companies like Wedgies are bringing polling to the masses so anyone from bloggers, to journalists, to TV execs can connect with their audience and gauge sentiment in real-time.  Wedgies is now the first fully integrated polling and survey option on Tumblr.This means Tumblr’s user base of roughly 110 million can now embed polls and surveys on any one of the 94 million posts published daily, straight from their dashboard.We caught up with Wedgies co-founders Jimmy Jacobson (pictured left) and Porter Haney (pictured right) over tacos and pancakes at SxSw to talk about what’s new and where Wedgies is headed.Building An Experience In Real Time
