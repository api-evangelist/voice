<p>Building a community around a new open source project is a tall order.Immediate feedback is critical when a collaborating developer opens a pull request on your GitHub project.One key component to a healthy repository community Iâ€™ve learned over the past year is to comment on and merge pull requests as soon as they are opened.The short feedback loop allows other developers to feel like their time was well spent by contributing to the open source project.However I found that I rarely saw the GitHub web notification option and often did not immediately check my email when a notification message hit my inbox.</p>
