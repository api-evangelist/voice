<p>We’re excited to partner with Parse for their first annual conference, Parse Developer Day, in San Francisco on September 5, 2013.Twilio Devangelist, Kevin Whinnery will be on scene to present “Building a Call Center in the Cloud with Parse and Twilio.” Kevin’s talk focuses on how to develop and deploy a call center without provisioning a server, setting up a database, or even hiring a dedicated back end developer.Say hello to our friends from Microsoft, Stripe, SendGrid and Xamarin at the Developer Day Partner Track.There will also be two Parse-focused tracks for both beginners and advanced Parse users.</p>
