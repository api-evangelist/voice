<p>Today, we are pleased to introduce a new way to find Twilio phone numbers in the Account Portal.The new Phone Number Search in the Account Portal makes it easier to search through millions of number options, in 600 different prefixes and area codes in nearly 50 countries.Finding the right phone number is an important task.Phone numbers represent geographies, different use-cases and often a brand identity that we all see even before we answer a call.At Twilio, we do our best to help by adding more phone number choices in existing and new geographies; and giving you the tools you need to find them.</p>
