<p>Tethr lets people get connected to each other and the Internet after a disaster.Itâ€™s a unique platform that lets people and organizations work together in difficult circumstances anywhere in the world whether they are online or offline.Tropo adds voice to the Tethr platform and allows you to take your tropo.com applications on the road with you.When you add Phono with WebRTC into the mix, you get a system that allows calls into applications on Tethr or between users connected to the WiFi.</p>
