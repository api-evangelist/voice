<p>Join the discussion on Hacker News!This tutorial is based on a workshop I gave at the Makerland conference in Poland.It will teach you how to wirelessly control a deadbolt lock without damaging or modifying the lock itself.We will be using an Arduino Uno, a servo, and Node.js to make it possible for you to lock and unlock your door via SMS.</p>
