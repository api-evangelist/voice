<p>As a developer running Windows discovering ngrok was like discovering manna from heaven.Exposing my local web server to the public internet, simplified debugging and testing of services like Twilio and a tool that did not make me install and configure other frameworks or language runtimes just to get started?It all had me smiling.However, as I’ve shown ngrok to other developers running Windows I’ve also learned that how you run ngrok on Windows depends on your specific system and certain configurations require a few extra steps to make ngrok work.In this post I’ll show you which configurations I’ve found need a bit more love and how you can set them up to use ngrok to expose your local web server to the internet.</p>
