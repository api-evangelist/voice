<p>For some time now we’ve been offering mobile advertisers in other markets the first 100 minutes of call tracking per month free of charge.And starting today, the same goes for mobile advertisers in Germany.For those of you who haven’t already installed our JavaScript on your website, Freespee Analytics lets you pinpoint which of your paid-for clicks are generating the best phone calls in response to your ads.And, armed with that information you can then optimize your ad placement and dramatically increase the number of quality leads you’re receiving.From our interaction with Freespee users – basically mobile advertisers whose target customers want to talk to someone before they buy or sign-up for a product or service – it’s become clear that tuning their click bids and ad placement was total guesswork until they started using our call tracking analytics.</p>
