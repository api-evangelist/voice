<p>As a result of customer feedback, we are making a few changes to improve our via our Carrier Lookup API end point which allows customers to look-up the Carrier/Network of a supplied phone number in the next few weeks.The pricing for carrier look-ups will not change.We are making these changes in an effort to improve the look-up detail in returning more refined data across operators for the global phone numbers.We are updating our international data to be more descriptive: with additional flags for SMS enabled networks and Networks that support actual devices vs.being phone numbers that belong to an OTT provider (over the top/app supported) or MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator).</p>
