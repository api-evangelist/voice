<p>Google’s own version of Siri is coming to the iPhone and iPad “soon,” according to the company.On Wednesday Google announced an update for its Chrome app is now available for Android and that another update for the Chrome for iOS app will follow “over the coming days” and include Voice Search.From Google’s blog post about it:

“You can now speak your searches into the omnibox.Touch the microphone, say your search query aloud and see your results (in some cases spoken back to you), all without typing a single letter.”

Unlike Siri, this is not integrated into the operating system, and can only be accessed through the Chrome app.</p>
