<p>Nicolas Grenie’s mother handed him a giant stack of papers for Christmas–686 pages to be exact.She printed out the entire Real Basic Reference Book, page by page, so Nicolas could learn to program.Years later, Nicolas is still learning, coding and teaching others to program as a Twilio Hero.Earlier this year we introduced you to the latest Twilio Heroes class, the Barn Owls.Over the past few months, they’ve been hard at work learning how to write technical tutorials, give an awesome live demo, and hone their developer skills so they can teach others how to code.</p>
