<p>Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems are everywhere – when you call the bank, when you use the hotel room telephone, even when you call the Queen!Okay – that last one probably doesn’t happen very often, but I bet the Windsors have an IVR for routing to the appropriate member of royalty.If you’re still a little bit unsure what an IVR is –  you have probably used one when you’ve called a number and heard something similar to this: 
“To talk to a human, press 1.To talk to an Owl, press 2.” 
This type of service is called an Interactive Voice Response.</p>
