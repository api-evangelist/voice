<p>With my home town still buzzing about the MLB All Star Game, it seemed high time to share part two of this series on building interactive voice mail for sports fans.In part one, we explored the high-level steps necessary to build an interactive voice mail system like the one deployed at leavejoeamessage.com.We saw how to set up a series of webhooks  in our node.js  backend to respond to incoming phone calls and text messages from fans, and how to store that data in a MongoDB  database.</p>
