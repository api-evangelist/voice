<p>TelAPI allows you to send messages around the globe.We offer interactive messaging with virtual numbers and allow one-way or two-way messaging via in-country short-codes/bulk SMS routes.Our focus is on deliverability; so we either connect directly with one of the in country operators or a central aggregators that is no more than 1 connection away from the destination operator.For notifications and time-sensitive messages, it is best to deliver messages via ShortCodes or Bulk 1-Way routes; As these routes provide you with delivery status notifications and update as the message gets delivered, which sometimes can mean: handset delivery confirmation.Since each country varies on what type of messaging is allowed, it is highly recommend you check our SMS features document, which will provide you insight on what Sender ID (within TelAPI, we call this the FROM address) requirements based on the country you are sending messages to.</p>
