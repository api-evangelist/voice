<p>MILPITAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--     
       noHold and Cisco collaborate on Virtual Assistant, SARA, Services Automated        Resolution Agent.As traditional Virtual Assistants (VAs)        and Virtual Customer Assistants (VCAs) aim to answer basic questions and        perform simple tasks, SARA will revolutionize the interaction by        integrating with sophisticated back office systems and deeper        understanding of complex problem resolution.Cisco has a vision, which is a significant shift from the traditional        support and services paradigm: Use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make        use of the data stored in networking devices such as routers, increase        speed to resolution, make real time updates, and perform tasks for        network administrators.In a simplified explanation, a scenario might        include a user with a problem in the datacenter.</p>
