<p>photo credit Im totally thankful for the experiences Ive had over the last 90 days in Washington D.C.as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and even more thankful Im able to keep doing much of the work I was doing during my fellowship.In reality, Im actually doing more work now, than I was in DC.While there were several challenges during my time as a PIF, the one that I regret the most, and is taking the longest to recover from, is losing my storytelling voice.</p>
