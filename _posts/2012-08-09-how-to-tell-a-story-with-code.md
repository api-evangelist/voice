{% include JB/setup %}<p>Whether you are in front of a packed room of hackers, a huddled group on a trade show floor or a sweaty basement filled with gutter punks, every audience just wants you to tell them a story. From sprint demos to superhero flicks, telling a good story is the surest way to captivate a human being’s attention, spark imagination and compel absorption of your ideas.Narrative is this crazy itch we all want scratched – if you think back to the last speech, song or standup routine that really grabbed your attention, chances are good that it told a story. This very human craving is something we try to feed on our developer evangelism team here at Twilio. But, I’ll be the first to admit, constructing a narrative out of code is damn tough.</p>
