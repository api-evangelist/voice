<p>A few months back I built some raised beds with the intention of giving my wife and I something to do on the weekends.However two things happened immediately after I built the beds that really hindered my gardening ambitions.First, the garden went totally insane sprouting up 4 foot brussel sprouts, producing more fat beets than Ryan Lewis and in general taking over our whole backyard.Second and more importantly, we had our first child.Needless to say the garden quickly became neglected.</p>
