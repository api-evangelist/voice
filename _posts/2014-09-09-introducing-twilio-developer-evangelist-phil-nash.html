<p>Community and sharing is everywhere in the web industry.From the act of asking a colleague for help on a beginner issue to the open source software that powers most of the Internet, the relationships between people drive how we learn and how we work.When I started learning to code I didn’t know this.I opted to sit back and listen, to be taught.Though I thought I was a good student I wasn’t seeking out those relationships and learning from others.</p>
