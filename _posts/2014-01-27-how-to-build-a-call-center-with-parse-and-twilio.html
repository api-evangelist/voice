<p>Back in September, Parse held their inaugural Parse Developer Day, a one day conference focused on empowering developers with new tools to help them deploy apps faster.Kevin Whinnery was on scene to present his talk “Building A Call Center With Parse And Twilio”, showing you how to develop and deploy a call center without provisioning a server, setting up a database, or even hiring a dedicated back end developer.Check out the post and video below as Kevin walks you through building a call center with Parse and Twilio.This was originally published on Parse’s Blog here 
API platforms like Parse and Twilio are changing the way developers build applications.By providing high-level building blocks for tasks like data persistence, user management, messaging, and VoIP communication, developers can rapidly assemble new software solutions when an opportunity arises.</p>
