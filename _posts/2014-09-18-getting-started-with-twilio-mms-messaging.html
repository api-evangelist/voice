<p>For the last century, humanity has maintained that “a picture is worth a thousand words”.While photos may have changed a lot, morphing from paper to pixels, that old adage is truer than ever in the digital age.Whether happy or heartbreaking, the millions of pictures we take every day help us tell our stories like no other medium can.The team at Twilio has been working very hard to bring the power of pictures to our messaging platform.And today, were are thrilled to announce that Picture Messaging has arrived for all US and Canadian numbers, giving you the power to speak a thousand words in a single message.</p>
