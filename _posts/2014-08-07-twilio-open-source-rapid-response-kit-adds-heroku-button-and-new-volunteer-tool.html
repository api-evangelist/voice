<p>Earlier this year, we released the Rapid Response Kit (RRK), a set of open source tools built for disaster relief efforts.The RRK lets first responders deploy much needed communication apps in minutes.The community response was incredible with developers offering their contributions to the project.Most recently the RRK was deployed by the Rhode Island Code for America fellows for the Providence Student Union to rally support through SMS broadcast on changing legislation around free bus passes for students.Today, we have two new capabilities in the RRK including a brand new tool and a one-click hosting addition that makes it even easier to deploy.</p>
