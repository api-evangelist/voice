<p>When I first started digging into writing apps for the iPhone, one of the first things I looked for in Xcode was some kind of package manager. It being the 21st century, I thought that obvious that nearly every IDE would have some kind of package manager built in, but to my surprise I found nothing in Xcode. But my search did not end there. I could not believe that iOS developers lived without a package manager of some kind. Thankfully a search on Google told me about CocoaPods, a great package manager for iOS developers that makes it pretty quick and painless to install and manage project dependencies.</p>
