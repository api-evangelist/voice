<p>In October, the FTC declared war against illegal, unsolicited robocalling, and asked developers to join them in the fight.The FTC offered $50,000 and an FTC Technology Achievement Award to the developer who could build the best tool to deter robocalling.Today, the FTC announced Aaron Foss’ Nomorobo as one of the two winners.Powered by Twilio, Nomorobo acts as a middleman, snuffing out illegal calls before they get to the consumer.So how does Nomorobo decide who’s a robocaller, who’s a legal telemarketer and act accordingly– all before your phone rings?</p>
