<p>Twilio recently introduced Test Credentials which gives you an easy way to use automated integration tests to exercise the parts of your application which use the Twilio REST API.Using test credentials, you can pretend to buy phone numbers, send SMS messages, or make phone calls without charging your account, updating the state of your account or connecting to real phone numbers.In this post I’ll show you how you can use Test Credentials to build automated integration tests for your application.I’ll be using the Visual Studio unit test framework for my samples, but the principles should apply to any unit test framework.Exploring Test Credentials
