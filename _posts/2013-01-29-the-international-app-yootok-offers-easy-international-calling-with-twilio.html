<p>When my two sisters were both abroad at the same time, it was hard finding time to Skype with three different schedules and three different time zones.It would have been easier just to call them, but that wasn’t an option as a broke college student.YOOtok is hoping to make keeping in touch with your loved ones while abroad cheaper and easier by offering international calling with Twilio.There’s a moment when you land in a foreign country and instinctively try to send a text, where you forget your phone doesn’t work internationally.Instead of finding the nearest airport kiosk that sells calling cards, you can download the YOOtok app and start making calls immediately via Twilio.</p>
