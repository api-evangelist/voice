<p>SOBERLINK is fighting an old old problem with new technology.They’re offering law enforcement and treatment centers a new way to stay in touch with patients, and monitor their alcohol consumption.Their alcohol monitoring tool, SL2, uses Twilio SMS to send test results to sponsors, family or friends.We talked with Heather Fitzgerald, Marketing and Communications Manager at SOBERLINK, about how they’re using Twilio, working with law enforcement, and what’s next.What was the inspiration for founding SOBERLINK?</p>
