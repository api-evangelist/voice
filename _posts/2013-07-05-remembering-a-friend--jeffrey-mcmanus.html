<p>When we were starting Twilio in 2008, the notion of a developer platform business was pretty far out there.When we were looking for advice, there weren’t very many who had meaningful insights into the challenges that lay ahead of us.In fact, most people just thought the idea was pretty foolish.That’s when our friend and advisor Dave Schappell recommended that we meet this guy — Jeffrey McManus.That’s how I was introduced to Jeffrey — and, what an apt introduction it was.</p>
