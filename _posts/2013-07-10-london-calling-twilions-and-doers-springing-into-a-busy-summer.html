<p>April and May saw us at an average of one event every couple of days – spreading the love, seeing your hacks, and scouting out entries for the first round of Twilio Fund Europe.Keen not to lose momentum in July, we’ve just come back from a three day road trip to Paris.We made the most of the opportunity to meet with some amazing accelerators, meet great developers and startups.We partnered with tech blog Rude Baguette to run a full day workshop to give an introduction to Twilio as a company, teach people more about the API, and talk about what we can do to help DOers in Europe.The party doesn’t stop here.</p>
