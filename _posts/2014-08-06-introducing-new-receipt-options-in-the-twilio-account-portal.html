<p>In the past few months we’ve added several features to the Twilio account portal to make life easier for developers.Whether you’re on the other side of the Atlantic, or the other side of the world, we want to make sure you have a great experience using Twilio.Today, we’re happy to announce Customizable Receipts that allow you to simplify accounting and tax-filing tasks.The billing section of the Twilio Account Portal is a resource for pay-as-you-go customers to examine usage, manage billing details, and print receipts for individual payments.With customized receipts, you can add personal information necessary for in-country tax deductions before printing and filing.</p>
