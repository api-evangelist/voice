<p>In our earlier blog post, Twilio for Phone Trees, we showed you how to create a phone tree using Twilio, Ruby, and Sinatra.In this post, we are going to apply one of the web developers most powerful tools, multivariate testing, to many companyâ€™s favourite communications tools, the phone tree.Multivariate testing will allow us to answer a lot of different questions about our phone tree: 
The idea of multivariate testing is simple: You start with a hypothesis that changing one aspect of your website will improve a metric that determines success.For example, suppose we have a website that sells toy owls.We currently have a picture of a Barn Owl on the site, but our hypothesis is that an Snowy Owl would lead to more sales.</p>
