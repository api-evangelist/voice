<p>For the last    co   uple of weeks our CTO Tobias (the main brain behind this beauty) has been working on making it happen.Our pioneering partner, media agency Forefront have also been of a huge help, testing it    with their customers and giving us their invaluable feedback.Thanks to those collaborative efforts, today weâ€™re ready to offer this feature to all our customers FOR FREE.So, in a nutshell, from now on you can see all your Freespee call data directly in your Google Analytics Report under the category Events.All the call info from your Freespee Dashboard is also pushed there, including the media type of the source, keywords, status (whether the call was answered or missed) and the duration of each call.</p>
