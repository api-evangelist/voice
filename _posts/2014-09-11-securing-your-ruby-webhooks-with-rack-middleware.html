<p>Hello fellow Rubyist, I see you have your shiny new Twilio application written, perhaps a Rails app or Sinatra, like in our Ruby quickstart guide.Before you hit that deploy button, you need to stop and ask yourself a couple of questions about that app.Do your webhooks expose sensitive data when they receive a request?Do they change data within your system?If your answer to either of those questions is yes, then you should be making sure that your app only responds to requests that come from Twilio.</p>
