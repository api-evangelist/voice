<p>Early Thursday, 5 June 2014, the OpenSSL team released an advisory detailing seven vulnerabilities affecting all maintained branches of OpenSSL. Our engineering team responded to the disclosure early this morning and completed the upgrade of our public-facing production infrastructure at 3:30 PM PDT.All our public endpoints are upgraded to protect against CVE-2014-0224 and the other vulnerabilities disclosed today.While we encourage our customers to upgrade to the latest versions of the Client SDKs as quickly as prudence demands, the upgrades to our public endpoints are sufficient to mitigate the vulnerability. No Twilio Client apps are currently vulnerable.</p>
