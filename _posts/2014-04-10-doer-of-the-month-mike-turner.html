<p>We profiled Mike Turner as DOer of the Month and featured his developer profile on the front page of the DOer Gallery.If  you’d like to share your story on the blog, create your DOer profile and email community@twilio.com 
  To say Mike Turner got his start early is an understatement.Mike got the idea for Staff Guardian, when he was just 11 years old.Now, a decade later, he’s turned that idea into a key component of his IT company, TurnKey IT Solutions.</p>
