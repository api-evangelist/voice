<p>Phil Leggetter is a Developer Evangelist at Pusher, a real-time web software.He’s been developing and using realtime web technologies for over 10 years.Pusher is one of our favorite APIs and we recently ran into Phil at a telephony meetup in San Francisco where he demoed a very cool Twilio and Pusher hack.  We asked Phil if he could share how he built his Pusher and Twilio app and he wrote an amazing tutorial below on how to build a realtime web app with Twilio.  A few weeks ago I gave a talk at the San Francisco Telephony Meetup, but since I work for Pusher my focus is the realtime web, and how realtime web technologies can add value to web and mobile applications, and not telephony.</p>
