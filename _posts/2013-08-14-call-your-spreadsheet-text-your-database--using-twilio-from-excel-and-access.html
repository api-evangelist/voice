<p>If you’ve used Windows like I have for the last 20 years, likely some of the most familiar pieces of software for you are Excel and Access.And even though these two pieces of software have thousands of features, to date apparently no one at Microsoft has ever thought to put a phone in them.Well today that changes.For better or worse, Microsoft Excel and Access are the backbone that power many organizational processes in companies big and small.Excel alone has been know to power the financial models of many businesses, and even entire countries.</p>
