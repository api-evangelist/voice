<p>When I was a young trick-or-treater I never missed the house on the hill that gave full-size candy bars; that was the Halloween destination on our street.But these days setting up the ideal trick-or-treating destination requires thinking outside the Snickers bar.I want kids to remember our house.I want parents to tell other parents about it.But more importantly I want a “surprise factor” when people discover our house.</p>
