<p>During SxSW I got a text from The Mad Hatter.“Next time I yell ‘I am a golden god!’ and jump into a pool, I’m checking my pockets so my cell doesn’t drown in that pool drool,’” he wrote.As much as I’d like to believe that the text came from The Mad Hatter himself, it actually came via SocialSamba, a new interactive storytelling platform focused on finding new avenues for the art of storytelling.The SocialSamba team at SxSW used Twilio to share The Mad Hatter, Huck Finn, and Nikola Tesla’s SxSW escapades with attendees via SMS.</p>
