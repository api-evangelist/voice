<p>In disaster recovery situations communications technologies are essential for rescue teams in the field, people in need of help, or connecting with family members to make sure they are ok.Many times these tools are built on the spot based on needs and sometimes the final apps aren’t deployed in time for the people that really need them.What if there were simple tools that any developer or organization could deploy at a moment’s notice?What if these tools were open source and powered by the community?We started the Twilio.</p>
