<p>Tickets to Burning Man sell out months and months before droves of people board converted school busses, load bikes onto the backs of cars and drive into the desert.When it came time to buy a ticket, Manuel Ebert missed the bus.Days before burning man he was desperate to find a ticket.He trolled forums, Craigslist, and tried his hand at asking friends but came up empty handed.Every forum post he responded to was a moment too late.</p>
