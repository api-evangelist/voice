<p>A free, open-source, API driven conference solution called Voice Chat API popped up on my API monitoring radar today, as I was going through my feeds.The Voice Chat API is a very cool, dead-simple conferencing solution.As a tool it provides clear value, and I really like the approach from Plivo to rollout out an open, API driven resource like this—a model that could be applied to other valuable resources.What really stands out is the Voice Chat API does one thing and does it well—audio conferences.It is easy to tell what it does.</p>
