<p>Django is often referred to as a “batteries included” Python web framework due to the many features that come with it out-of-the-box.It is becoming an increasingly popular choice for developers who want to build web applications in Python.Django is my personal choice when developing web apps as I love the huge collection of contributed libraries and the great community developing the software.When I think about how MVC web frameworks should work; Django fits it almost perfectly.Let’s build a simple application that responds with an SMS message when you send an SMS message to it.</p>
