<p>Twilio just announced a new API billing solution called Twilio Connect.&nbsp;The new billing solution enables developers to offload charges for Twilio API usage to their application users, rather than their own Twilio accounts, and billing customers separately.Twilio Connect is modeled after OAuth in that it uses a &ldquo;two-legged&rdquo; process for application users to setup and authenticate a payment relationship with Twilio, that a developer can leverage within their app using a token.To start, developers put a Twilio Connect button in their application.&nbsp;Application users then click the button and are taken to a secure Twilio page that allows them to setup a new Twilio account, requiring only the minimal needed information: &nbsp;name, billing info, and email.</p>
