<p>In May of 2012, Xin Chi (pictured right)was held at knifepoint and thrown into the trunk of her car by kidnappers while running errands in a mall in Kuala Lumpur.After narrowly escaping, she dedicated herself to finding a way to protect women in their day to day life.Months after her kidnapping attempt, Xin Chi founded WatchOverMe, a mobile watchdog app with over 140,000 users, dedicated to keeping men and women safe through proactive alerts.The first incarnation of WatchOverMe served as a personal bodyguard to alert family, friends and authorities when you’re in danger.Now, Xin and her team are focusing on a more proactive approach — steering users clear of dangers they didn’t know were there.</p>
