<p>Rob Zazueta may be new to Mashery, but he has over 15 years of development and documentation experience.Only two and a half weeks into his new job as Director of Platform Strategy at Mashery, Rob stopped by our Twilio Tech Talk Meetup to share his thoughts on empowering users with quality documentation in his talk “Technical Documentation: Building Beyond The Manual”
 Twilions Nisha George and Elaine Tsai talked about crafting documentation with support in mind.“We want customers to feel like they have a place to go to get their questions answered in the middle of going through their code” said Nisha.Watch their talk “Support Driven Documentation”, as well as Rob’s talk below.Join our Meetup Group to find out about other Twilio Tech Talks and events.</p>
