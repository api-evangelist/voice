<p>Google App Engine enables developers to focus on their application’s logic by providing a scalable infrastructure and high-level APIs for persistence, file management, and other common web app needs.XMPP and Channels are among these APIs, making it ridiculously easy to write awesome real-time communications apps in the browser.Today, we’re going to break down an example application (view it live, source code) that integrates these two App Engine services (plus SMS messaging from Twilio) in a group chat application that connects users via SMS, XMPP, and browser-based chat clients.We won’t go through every line of code, but at a high level, this application is about receiving inbound messages and sending outbound messages.Let’s see how we do this via SMS, XMPP, and Channels.</p>
