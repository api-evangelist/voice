<p>We are launching a minor update to Skype for Android today to address some of the feedback we’ve received over the past week.We heard you loud and clear and want to provide you with the best experience possible when using the redesigned application.You wanted an easier way to sign out.Now you can find this option by hitting the Menu key or on any of these navigation screens: Recent, Favorites, People and Profile.We addressed a bug that was not allowing users to go online or make/receive calls if their status was last set to offline in version 3.</p>
