<p>Today we’re pleased to release an update to Skype for Windows Phone 8, version 2.11.In this release we’ve continued to focus on addressing user feedback and we’ve made some performance and quality improvements which will improve the stability of the app.We’ve received a lot of feedback from users about how they’d like to manage conversations, such as choosing what does and doesn’t show up in the Recent list.So in this release, you’ll now be able to hide a conversation just by tapping and holding on it in the Recent list, and selecting ‘remove’.</p>
