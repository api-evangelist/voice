<p>The International Telecommunications Union, the telecom agency for the United Nations, recently released some data suggesting for every 100 people on Planet Earth, 96 of them have a subscription to a cellular service. That means there are nearly as many cell subscriptions out there as human beings – a stonking 6.8 billion.Holy biscuits – that means there might well be more cell phones out there than people.With Twilio, you can build apps with that touch every last one of them.</p>
