<p>Over the weekend, Twilio participated in our first-ever developer event in India, supporting around 300 developers in the Business of API hackathon.37 hacks were demoed, and we were very impressed with the results.As always, Twilio DOers led the way with 25 of the 37 teams incorporating voice, SMS and VoIP in some capacity.One Twilio hack connected a user to a contact with custom deceptive background noise, from traffic horns to a crying baby, to justify being late for dinner or canceling an appointment.We saw a feature phone-only social network that connected users to one another based on common interests.</p>
