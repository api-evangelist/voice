<p>Today we’ve released version 6.12 of Skype for Mac.The release mainly focuses on improving stability and reducing crashes – whether you’re using instant messaging, on an audio call, or on a video call.We’ve also improved performance at launch time and made low-level changes which will reduce random crashes.Following the search improvement in the last release, we also further expanded its functionality so you can search for text in status messages.</p>
