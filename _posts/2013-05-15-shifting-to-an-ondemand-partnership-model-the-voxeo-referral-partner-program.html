<p>Historically, partnering with a new vendor is a decision made after a significant amount of consideration due to the commitment required in becoming a partner.This commitment often means switching to an entirely different product line, retraining sales and technical resources to sell, support and develop on a new platform and can sometimes mean cutting a large check to the vendor as a partnering fee.A business must be nimble enough that they can quickly shift directions to meet their customer’s changing needs.When these needs involve a solution the partner doesn’t already offer, an agile, flexible vendor is a key component to ensuring the partner can deliver exactly what the customer needs.Voxeo knows that we are in the midst of a changing communications landscape and that there are fresh challenges facing businesses who want to add new and improved customer interaction channels.</p>
