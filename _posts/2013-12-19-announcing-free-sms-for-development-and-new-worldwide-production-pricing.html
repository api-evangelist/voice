<p>As I’m sure you’ve noticed, a lot of things have been changing around Tropo lately, including new partnerships with telco operators around the world, a corporate name change, and a brand new website.  But one thing that hasn’t changed is our commitment to developers.We’re happy to announce that Tropo SMS is now completely free for development.  While you’re testing your app, bootstrapping your startup, racing to win the next hackathon, you don’t need to worry about “topping up” your Tropo account with cash…we have you covered.  And when you’re ready to move your application to production, you’ll know exactly what your pricing will be.</p>
