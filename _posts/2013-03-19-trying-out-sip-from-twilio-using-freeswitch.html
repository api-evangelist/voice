<p>Twilio recently introduced the new <Sip> noun which lets you directly dial a SIP server from your Twilio app.But what if you don’t have a SIP server?In this post I’ll show you how you can set up and use FreeSWITCH, a free, cross platform and open source communication server that includes SIP capabilities, to try out the noun.Before you get started setting up the FreeSWITCH server, it’s useful to have at least a cursory understanding of what SIP is.SIP, or session initiation protocol, is a common protocol used by IP Telephony equipment and software to create and manage communication sessions between two parties.</p>
