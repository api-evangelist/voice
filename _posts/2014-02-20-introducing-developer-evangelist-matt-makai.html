<p>The pit in my stomach fell through the floor when I suspected that I had selected the wrong tab on the SSH client to type ‘DROP DATABASE’ into.The emails that came flooding into my inbox over the next few minutes were not a promising sign.“Hey, I was working on a wiki page and now I’m getting an error.”
 “I’m trying to show the new hires our internal policies but I can’t bring up our website.”
  
 The unfortunate mess which I suddenly found myself in was my fault despite good intentions.</p>
