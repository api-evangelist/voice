<p>Back in 2012, we wrote a post that showed you how easy it was set up a simple data collection system using Twilio SMS and a Google Spreadsheet. Well its 2 years later and  some things have changed. In this post we’ll walk through an updated version of the little utility that makes it easy for developers and non-developers alike to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet called TwilioSheet.I write a lot of simple little SMS applications, but they can be daunting at times.I often wonder if the idea is worth the time it takes to write the code to store, process, and act on the incoming messages.</p>
