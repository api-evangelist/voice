<p>Waiting for your food to arrive while you’re out to dinner is one thing.Waiting for your food to arrive after you’ve already been waiting an hour for delivery is another.Five friends from Austin, TX founded a crowd-sourced food delivery business to cut down on wait times and refine the delivery workflow with Twilio SMS.Burpy was founded by 5 native Texans, who alot have more than just a passion for startups in common.Two of the founders are cousins, and the whole gang has known each other since 4th grade.</p>
