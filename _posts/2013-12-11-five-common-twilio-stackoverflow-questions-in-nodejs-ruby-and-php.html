<p>Hi folks.A few weeks ago I came across a question on StackOverflow about the Twilio verb <Gather> that I thought was really interesting.It reminded me of why I love StackOverflow and it gave me an idea.The idea was to identify common Twilio questions on StackOverflow and use them as a jumping off point to discuss some cool utilities available in the Twilio API.Additionally, this post gives us a chance to elaborate on the black and white solutions provided on StackOverflow and bring them into the technicolor world.</p>
