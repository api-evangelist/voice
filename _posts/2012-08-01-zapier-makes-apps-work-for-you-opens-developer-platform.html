<p>When three friends got together for Startup Weekend, they wanted to solve a problem for vendors who had a difficult time building out app integrations.Specifically, they wanted to provide a service where people could combine their favorite apps like Evernote and Google Calendar without having to know how to code.Co-founded by Wade Foster, Bryan Helmig and Mike Knoop, Zapier lets users drag and drop app integrations on a simple dashboard interface.The platform currently offers over 60 different apps and today Zapier announced the launch of their developer platform.Now, any company or developer can add an app to the library for users to build Zaps.</p>
