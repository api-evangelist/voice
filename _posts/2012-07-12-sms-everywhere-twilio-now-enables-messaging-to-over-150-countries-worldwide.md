<p>Today we launched Twilio SMS capabilities globally so that developers can send SMS messages to any destination around the world.This was the most widely requested feature ever by the community and we are thrilled to enable this for US and Canadian Twilio numbers.Now developers can enable their Twilio numbers to send and receive SMS message to over 150 countries worldwide, using the exact same API.This means developers can reach anyone in the world with voice and SMS, as simple as using the web.Twilio SMS is also now multi-lingual with support for dozens of languages including Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Greek, and Russian.</p>
