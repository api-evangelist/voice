<p>In the summer of last year, we noticed a really cool, telephone-powered, interactive advertising experience created for Nike and basketball star LeBron James.In the short commercial spot, notable people like Spike Lee, Warren Buffet, and Dr.Dre are heard leaving voicemail messages for the NBA finals MVP, congratulating him on the championship.If you haven’t already, you can check out the video below, and a quick write up on the spot as the “Creativity Pick of the Day” in Advertising Age: 
The ad ends with a live phone number that fans could call to leave a message for LeBron.We thought this was a really neat way to allow fans to interact with a celebrity or brand – and with Twilio, it’s actually pretty easy to do.</p>
