<p>A few months ago we released our Usage API, which allows developers to make a single API request to get their usage stats for a given time period.This way, companies can build dashboards or internal tools to figure out what they’re doing with Twilio.(For more information, please visit our REST API documentation).Today, we are very excited to announce a new integration with Ducksboard, a company that lets users design, display and share their company’s most important data in a beautiful way.With our Usage API, Ducksboard built a preconfigured dashboard for Twilio where users simply enter their Twilio Account SID and AuthToken and the dashboard will automatically be created to reflect their Twilio usage.</p>
