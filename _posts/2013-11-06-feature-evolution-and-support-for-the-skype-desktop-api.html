<p>One of the exciting things about communications is that the field and the technology are always changing and at Skype, we are continually investing in technology improvements to keep bringing innovation in communications to as many of our users as possible.As Mark Gillett described in his Technology Changes to Improve the Skype Experience blog post – the team has been hard at work updating our infrastructure and evolving our experiences across all our supported platforms.  The investments we’re making in Skype – to a highly mobile, cloud connected world – come with some key changes to our application and service architecture, and by extension – our support for the Desktop API used by 3rd party developers to extend Skype functionality. Previously we shared that we would retire the Desktop API later this year.However, I’m happy to share that we will be extending support for two of the most widely used features – call recording and compatibility with hardware devices – until we determine alternative options or retire the current solution.</p>
