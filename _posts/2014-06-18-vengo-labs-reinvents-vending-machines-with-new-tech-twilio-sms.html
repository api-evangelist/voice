<p>In 2012, Brian Shimmerlik (pictured right) tackled a tough question posed by NYC Next Idea: “what does the future of New York City advertising look like?” His answer was a new breed of vending machines called Vengos.These aren’t your typical “put in a dollar, press A2, and watch your bag of chips get stuck” vending machines.Vengos have a slick touch screen and offer anything from gum and candy, to discounts on Uber rides.The idea won Brian the NYC Next Idea competition and founded Vengo Labs.</p>
