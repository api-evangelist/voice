<p>One of the big buzzwords surrounding CES this year was about the “Internet of Things” (or, IoT). IoT refers to uniquely identifiable objects and their virtual representations in an Internet-like structure. Popular IoT devices today range from home automation devices like connected thermostats, intelligent lighting, smart power and water meters, drones, wearables and many more. In fact, it’s estimated that by 2020, there could be as many as 30 Billion IoT devices connected to the Internet.Famed Tropo developer and Phoenix Hacker-at-Large, Chris Matthieu, has developed SkyNet.</p>
