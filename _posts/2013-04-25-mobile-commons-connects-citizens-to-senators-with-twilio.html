<p>Mobile Commons is giving citizens the communication tools they need to spark political action.They’re powering the communication technology behind Mayors Against Illegal Guns’ (MAIG) campaign to pass more comprehensive gun laws.Mobile Commons and MAIG’s joint effort called, Demand Action, allows citizens to contact their local senator’s office directly via Twilio.When you call Demand Action’s Twilio number, you’ll be prompted with talking points for your senator’s office in addition to information you need to show your support.Then you’ll hear the friendly Twilio voice alerting you that you’re being connected to your senator’s office.</p>
