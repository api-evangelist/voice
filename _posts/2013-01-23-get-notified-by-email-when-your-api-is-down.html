<p>We just launched a small yet very important feature - an email notification to the API provider when the API is down.This feature is in line with our commitment to provide API providers with the necessary tools to keep them on top of things, and be able to react quickly to their developers when the API is down (e.g.send out a message to acknowledge the downtime, issue out a fix, etc).If you wish to turn off the notification for your API, you can do so by navigating to your API Admin -> Settings:
  
 We hope you like this feature!</p>
