<p>Among comic book fans, Marvel’s Age of Apocalypse storyline is a fan favorite.Without geeking out too much, the story explores an alternate universe where a young Professor X dies saving Magneto from an assassination attempt and as a result Magneto goes on to found the X-Men.What made Age of Apocalypse so great is it challenged the audience’s assumptions about every character.Even casual comic book fans know that Magneto is a villain, but in this universe he’s the good guy.What about the loveable Hugh Jackman as Wolverine?</p>
