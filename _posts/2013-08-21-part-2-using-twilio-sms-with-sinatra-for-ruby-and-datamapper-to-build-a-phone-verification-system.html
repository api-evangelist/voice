<p>About a year ago, we published an update to our phone verification tutorial to teach you how to keep your users safe and prevent fraud when building applications in PHP.Now you can learn how to employ the same security and anti-spam techniques in Ruby using the elegant Sinatra framework.For any application that interacts with phones, you will need to be able to verify a user’s phone number to prevent fraud, spam and mistakes when entering numbers.One of the methods of verifying a number is by using an automated phone call and prompting the user to enter a code.However, since we already covered that method of verification in our previous PHP phone verification post, today we are going to verify the user’s number using an SMS message.</p>
