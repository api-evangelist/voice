<p>You could order prints from a big manufacturer and pay for more than you need.Or, go to a local printer and pay more than you should.Tim Lamm built Diginate to occupy that happy medium in between: offering custom printing at any quantity, at a reasonable price.Diginate uses Twilio SMS to keep their customers updated on the status of their order from the first press to the final shipment.We talked to founder Tim about how heâ€™s using Twilio, and his special discount for Twilio blog readers.</p>
