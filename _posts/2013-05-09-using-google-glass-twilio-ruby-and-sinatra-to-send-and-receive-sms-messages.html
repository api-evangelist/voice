<p>Myself and other developers have been giddy with glee at the recent release of Google Glass, one of the first largely available wearable computing platforms.After the Glass Foundry hackathons in January, I couldn’t wait to start building awesome applications such as GlassTweet with the Mirror API and helping others do the same.Today, I’d like to debut the first tutorial on building Twilio applications for Google Glass, where you will learn how to receive SMS messages via a Twilio phone number on your Google glass and how to respond to them using the Glass voice commands.Glass can send and receive SMS by default via the MyGlass Android app.However, I often use Twilio phone numbers for people I would not be comfortable giving my real phone number to.</p>
