<p>Letâ€™s be honest: traditional call centers have a terrible user experience.You see something interesting on a website that you want more information about.Email takes too long, so that option is out of the question.What do you do?You search for a phone number (hidden in their contact page at the bottom in tiny text), place a phone call, give away all your details, and (eventually) you end up getting to a human who might be able to help you.</p>
