<p>Everybody wants to know the latest news and there are many applications that provide users with up to the minute news posts and articles.But what about the people who are moving around, rushing to or from work and simply don’t have a minute to stop and read the articles that are of interest to them?That’s where Umano fits in.It’s basically a simple application created to deliver news to people on the go, turning online content into quality audio content read aloud by professional voice actors.Umano’s API makes it possible for developers to access this cool functionality and integrate it with other applications as well.</p>
