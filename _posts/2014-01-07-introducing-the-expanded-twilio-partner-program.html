<p>In August of 2011, TalkDesk was just an app Tiago Paiva (pictured right) built for our Twilio Client Competition.Tiago won the competition and flew from Portugal to San Francisco to the inaugural TwilioCon where he won yet another Twilio challenge, and earned a spot in Twilio Fund, backed by 500 Startups.Now, two years later, TalkDesk is a proud Twilio Partner delivering Call Center solutions to companies like Chevrolet, Mindvalley and SideCar.Twilio Partners like TalkDesk are building communications solutions that empower their customers to succeed.Today, weâ€™re happy to announce an expanded Partner Program that will give companies building B2B solutions more access to marketing, sales and technical resources to help them grow.</p>
