<p>Since we launched Skype for Xbox One* in November, we’ve been hard at work improving the living room experience for Skype users.Today we are excited to announce the first update to Skype for Xbox One, which brings several new features: 
#1 Improved Chat: We know that many of our users jump between using Skype on their PC to their phone and now to their living room.So we’ve been focused on enhancing this experience, keeping conversations in sync and reducing the number of missed messages to make your chat experience even better.Improved chat is now synchronized and comes with push notifications, alerting you when a new message arrives, and providing a longer chat history – up to 1,000 messages, rather than just the past 7 days.#2 Marvel’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier Emoticons: As you might have seen earlier today, Skype chat now has new “hidden heroes” emoticons based on characters from Marvel’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier to convey even more action-packed emotion with your Skype friends.</p>
