<p>At 14 years old, Miguel Kudry (pictured right) started building apps.Now at age 20, he’s launched his second company, Help Hub, a new social platform that connects students with tutors via Twilio Voice.I can’t exactly picture Miguel needing a tutor for “Computer Science 101” or “Introduction to Business Administration”.While a full time student pursuing a degree in business, Miguel is running Help Hub to give students a new avenue for mentorship and academic help.Using HelpHub, students can search for the subject they need help with, pick from tutors who are experts in that area, and schedule a call.</p>
