<p>Â  Screen Pops are a way of displaying contextual information to an agent about any incoming call so that they can provide more relevant support to the caller.They are one of the most powerful features of a software-powered voice communication system.They let your agent learn about the customer they are servicing as soon as the phone rings, look up an anonymous caller so that they can prioritize the importance of their call, or simply forward the call to the most relevant representative before the caller even has to ask.In this tutorial we are going to build a layer on top of our Twilio Client Quickstart for Node.jsthat automatically looks up the name and photo of any incoming caller using the FullContact API.</p>
