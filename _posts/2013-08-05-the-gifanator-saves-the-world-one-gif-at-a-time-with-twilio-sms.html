<p>As a new coder, Joanne Daudier, embraced the challenges of building an app.Her idea for her first app was just a simple joke within her circle of friends– until Joanne took it seriously and built Gifanator, an app that allows you to send GIFs to friends.Joanne’s app allows users to send and receive GIFs via Twilio SMS.They can choose a specific GIF, select from different categories of GIFs based on an emotion, or click the random button and see what they get.Let’s say you wanted an awesome “Deal With It” GIF to share with your friends.</p>
