At TelAPI, we strive to deliver the most robust telephony platform on the market, allowing developers to mix-and-match our API to deliver complete enterprise solutions.Our new Carrier Lookup API allows you to perform a real-time carrier/provider lookup on any phone number (mobile/landline).We aggregate this data from in-country local number portability as well as line-range databases maintained by country specific number registry providers.The carrier lookup API provides accurate and real-time information so you can act on it by delivering targeted services and marketing to your end-users.Below is an example of the data you can expect when sending a carrier lookup request to TelAPI.</p>
