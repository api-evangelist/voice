<p>Developer Hung Truong started putting together basic websites when Geocities was still in style (if it ever was).Now, Hung is an iOS developer at a creative marketing company in Ann Arbor Michigan.In his free time he likes making apps (like award winning Weathergram) that help automate daily tasks from turning your lights on and off, checking in on Foursquare, and checking the weather.We talked to Hung about how he got started coding, what type of apps he’s interested in building with Twilio, his Callin’ Oates inspiration, and why code literacy is so important.We profiled Hung Truong and featured his developer profile on the front page of the DOer Gallery.</p>
