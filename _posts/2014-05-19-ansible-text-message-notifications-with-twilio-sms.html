<p>Nothing puts a damper on a developer’s work day quite like coming back from lunch to find a broken application deployment.But who wants to bring their laptop to lunch with them to check deployment progress?Life would be so much easier if you could just receive a text message on your phone when the deployment completes successfully or if something goes horribly wrong that needs fixing.Fortunately if you’re using the Ansible configuration management tool as part of your application deployment process there’s a new core notification module called Twilio to send critical deployment updates by text message so you only need your cell phone with you during lunchtime taco stand trips.Ansible Notification Modules 
Ansible is an open source configuration management and application deployment tool.</p>
