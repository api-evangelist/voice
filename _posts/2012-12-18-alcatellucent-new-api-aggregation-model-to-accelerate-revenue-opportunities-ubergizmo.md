{% include JB/setup %}<p>[MWC 2010] Today Alcatel-Lucent announced a new cloud based developer platform that will drastically change the traditional API (application programming interface) aggregation model, according to the company.Alcatel-Lucentâ€™s developer platform provides service providers and enterprises with tools that enable partners and third-party developers to build, test, manage and distribute applications across networks, including television, broadband Internet and mobile.The company claims that its new platform will make the application development process more efficient, will accelerate the distribution across networks and will boost the whole ecosystem revenue.To achieve this goal, Alcatel Lucent is launching a set of developer tools including a Virtual SandBox and a Dashboard.Additionally, the new platform will offer a bundling model for revenue sharing, combining a collection of two or more APIs/Web services that developers can use to create a new application, eliminating the upfront API fees traditionally required.</p>
