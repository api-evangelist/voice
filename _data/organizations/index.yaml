    Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. Polly lets
    you create applications that talk, enabling you to build entirely new
    categories of speech-enabled products. Polly is an Amazon AI service that
    uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds
    like a human voice. Polly includes 47 lifelike voices spread across 24
    languages, so you can select the ideal voice and build speech-enabled
    applications that work in many different countries. Amazon Polly delivers
    the consistently fast response times required to support real-time,
    interactive dialog. You can cache and save Polly&rsquo;s speech audio to
    replay offline or redistribute. And Polly is easy to use. You simply send
    the text you want converted into speech to the Polly API, and Polly
    immediately returns the audio stream to your application so your application
    can play it directly or store it in a standard audio file format, such as
    MP3. With Polly, you only pay for the number of characters you convert to
    speech, and you can save and replay Polly&rsquo;s generated speech.
    Polly&rsquo;s low cost per character converted, and lack of restrictions on
    storage and reuse of voice output, make it a cost-effective way to enable
    Text-to-Speech everywhere.
